# Sorting-Algorithm
There are numerous sorting algorithms available, each with unique properties and ideal application scenarios. Here are a few popular sorting formulas:

Toggling Sort/Bubble Sort:
Simple and Obvious.
Due to its O(n2) time complexity, it is not appropriate for processing huge datasets.
if the items are in the improper sequence, it continuously switches the neighbouring ones.

Placement Sort/Insertion Sort:
Efficient for almost-sorted data or small datasets.
Has an O(n2) worst-case and average time complexity.
By continually inserting a new element into the portion of the array that has already been sorted, builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

Choosing Sort/Selecton Sort:
Simple and simple to comprehend.
O(n2) and unsuitable for huge datasets.
Divides the input between a zone that is sorted and one that is not, then repeatedly chooses the minimum element.
